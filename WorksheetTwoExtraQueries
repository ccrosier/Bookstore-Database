FROM Book B JOIN Publisher P 
WHERE b.PubID = p.PID 
GROUP BY Publisher

2. Plain english: Title of every book with an average rating of 4/5 or higher that has been reviewed at least 10 times
Relational algebra:
R1 <- (BISBN |F| count(BISBD), avg(Rating) Review)
Result <- ΠTitle(σavg(Rating)>= 4(Book  ⋈ISBN=BISBNR1))
SQL Query: 
with R1 AS (SELECT b.BISBN, COUNT(BISBN), AVG(r.Rating) AS avg_rating FROM r Review, b Book GROUP BY BISBN)
with Result AS (SELECT b.Title FROM b Book JOIN R1 on b.ISBN = R1.BISBN WHERE R1.avg_Rating >= 4)
SELECT Title FROM Result;


3. Plain English: The PenFirstName of every author that has written a book in the genre fiction
Relational Algebra:
R1<- σGenre="fiction"(Book)
Result <- ΠPenFirstName(Author ⋈AID=AuID R1)

with Result as (SELECT DISTINCT a.PenFirstName From Author a JOIN R1 ON a.AID = R1.AuID)
